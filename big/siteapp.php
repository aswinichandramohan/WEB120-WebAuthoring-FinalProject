    <p>As of now mobile users are quite getting larger over last few years. According to the article, Responsive Website vs Mobile App of ThinkMobiles.com, “The quantity of mobile phone users is going to increase worldwide from 4.01 billion in 2013 to 5.07 billion in 2019. In 2016 almost 63% of the Earth’ population already owned a mobile phone” (“Responsive Website vs Mobile App: Comparison”).

	<p>Both responsive website and native mobile app are built according to performance/functionality requirements, product development cost, features, and target audience. If we need very high performance, I would say the mobile application does it, and it provides optimal levels of engagement and productivity. Next come affordability, the responsive website takes less developing cost than mobile application. Scott Bolinger of AppPresser.com stated that, “The winner depends on your business. For the casual blogger, the mobile website wins. For a company like Instagram, the mobile app wins” (Bolinger).</p>

	<p>As per Joe Parker of KnowBand.com, “The market size for mobile eCommerce (electronic commerce) is estimated above $40 billion. And if you take a look at this study, you’ll find that 86% of the time users spend is on mobile apps whereas; only 14% is devoted to browsing the websites on their mobile phones” (Parker). As mobile phone users are increasing every year, the prominence of mobile-commerce has increased as well. E-commerce applications could be a favored choice for the online customers. Having a website especially for a business is not enough and E-commerce mobile app becoming mandatory.</p>
